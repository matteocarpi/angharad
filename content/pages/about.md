biography: |-
  I am a Performer, Designer, and Performance Maker,  from Wales UK.

  After graduating from the Royal Welsh Collage of Music and Drama in 2005, with a BA hons in Theatre Design, I began my career touring throughout Wales and Europe with international directors, choreographers and performance makers, specialising in costume and set design, for theatre, dance and circus.

  This journey lead me back to my childhood passion for dance and my ongoing curiosity for movement practice. In 2009, I completed the professional dance training program at Rubicon Dance, and later went on to receive the Emerging Artist residency with Volcano Theatre. During this time I also became a founding member of Nurture Creative Dance Theatre based at Rubicon Dance, where I began developing my own choreographic process with ‘The Audition’ funded by Arts Council Wales.

  Over the last 15 years I have worked extensively throughout Wales and Europe with a variety of theatre, dance, and circus companies, including National Theatre Wales, National Dance Company Wales, Nofit State Circus, and The Gothenburg Opera.

  In 2019 I completed my MA in Devised Theatre and Performance Practices with LISPA (Arthaus Berlin) and Rose Bruford Collage. I now reside in Berlin where I continue my ongoing practice and research in collaborative performance making.

  As a creator, deviser and performer, I believe that multi disciplinary and cross cultural collaboration is vital in the continuation and growth of artistic practice.

  My work explores universal themes of human consciousness, society and culture, drawing inspiration from individual and collective experience.

  Drawing upon my expertise in design, my passion for visual story telling and the poetic body, my ambition is to create highly sensory, emotive work, which blurs the boundaries between theatre, dance and visual arts.
