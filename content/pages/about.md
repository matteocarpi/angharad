title: About
biography: "I am a Theatre Designer, Practitioner and Performer from Wales UK.\n\nAfter
  graduating from the Royal Welsh Collage of Music and Drama in 2005, with a BA hons
  in Theatre Design, I began my career touring throughout Wales and Europe with international
  directors, choreographers and performance makers, specialising in costume and set
  design, for theatre, dance and circus.\n\nThis journey lead me back to my childhood
  passion for dance and my ongoing curiosity for movement practice. In 2009, I completed
  the professional dance training program at Rubicon Dance, and later went on to receive
  the Emerging Artist residency with Volcano Theatre. During this time I also became
  a founding member of Nurture Creative Dance Theatre based at Rubicon Dance, where
  I began developing my own choreographic process with ‘The Audition’ funded by Arts
  Council Wales.\n\nOver the last 15 years I have worked extensively throughout Wales
  and Europe with a variety of theatre, dance, and circus companies, including National
  Theatre Wales, National Dance Company Wales, Nofit State Circus, and The Gothenburg
  Opera.\n\nIn 2019 I completed my MA in Devised Theatre and Performance Practices
  with LISPA (Arthaus Berlin) and Rose Bruford Collage. I now reside in Berlin where
  I continue my ongoing practice and research in collaborative performance making.\n\nAs
  a creator, deviser and performer, I believe that multi disciplinary and cross cultural
  collaboration is vital in the continuation and growth of artistic practice.\n\nMy
  work explores universal themes rooted in human nature, society and culture, drawing
  inspiration from individual and collective experience. \n\nDrawing upon my expertise
  in design, my passion for visual story telling and the poetic body, my ambition
  is to create highly sensory, emotive work, which blurs the boundaries between theatre,
  dance and visual arts."
