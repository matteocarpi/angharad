Maite and her sisters, Paula and Nora, have gone through changes, as all families have. They’ve weathered storms, at moments they’ve drifted apart but somehow they’ve held together.

But when their mother, Margaret, makes the drastic decision to sell the family home, something cracks open. Ghosts and memories start to seep out and the family is confronted with things they did not expect: some hidden, some lost and some purposefully forgotten. The waters start to rise.

Meanwhile a woman in white with an empty cage walks endlessly through the generations, in the space in between, like where the land meets the sea. Waiting for the bird that’s flown away? Or waiting to be released herself?

And underneath everything the sea, ebbing and flowing. The tide rising and falling. What will pass down the generations and what can be washed away as the waters rise?

_Ulua(k) Teatro presents “Maite” (working title), a work-in-progress piece which brings together full expressive masks, object manipulation and original music in a darkly fantastical, moving and comical journey through the generations, through the ebb and flow of one family._
