# **SACRE**

### ROY ASSAF - Göteborgs Opera

Multi-award winning Israeli choreographer [Roy Assaf](https://en.opera.se/om-oss/personal/portratt/roy-assaf/) is well-known for his gender perspective on dance. His raving _Sacre_ – performed to Stravinsky’s explosive The Rite of Spring – is performed by an all-female and all-male cast; 2 x Rite of Spring! It seduces, entertains and eludes, ending in an surprising sacrifice. With the Göteborgs Opera Orchestra performing Stravinsky's music live on stage.
