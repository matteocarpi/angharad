Sometime - it could have been yesterday or last month or last year - an angel arrived in Berlin. They say she fell from the sky and, finding there was no way back, she set out on foot into the city.

"Somewhere, Maybe Here" is a performance about who and what the angel met on her journey. With two slapstick clown-presenters, a silent film – created from the unplanned interaction between the angel and the public on the streets of Berlin – and live piano, "Somewhere, Maybe Here" is an intimate, live encounter that is by turns comedic, nostalgically poetic and deeply moving.

After a hugely successful preview at the Euskal Zine Bilera film festival in the Basque Country at the end of 2018, "Somewhere, Maybe Here" comes home to Berlin for two preview performances at Theaterhaus Berlin Mitte, before going on to premiere in late Spring. Please join us for this part-performance, part-ritual and full-invitation: for a moment to be really Here.
