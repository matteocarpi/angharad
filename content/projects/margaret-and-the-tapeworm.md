An uninvited guest lurking at the office buffet brings surprising consequences for love-lorn Margaret and determinedly festive Amber.

As this trio collides we discover that, person or parasite, no-one wants to be alone at Christmas.

Triongl is a company of 3 women dedicated to producing original theatre with humour and social relevance.

Triongl are associate artists on the Peilot Programme at Chapter Arts Centre, Cardiff.
