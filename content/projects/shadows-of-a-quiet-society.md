_Shadow of a Quiet Society_ follows on from the success of Gwyn Emberton Dance’s award winning dance theatre production _My People_.

Inspired by the stories and people from Emberton’s hometown of Montgomery, _Shadow of a Quiet Society_ explores what happens when the people of a small community all have big ideas about who they are.

An all-female cast of internationally renowned dancers, including Eddie Ladd, portray a host of archetypal characters that fight to fit into a world that's not really for them. Together with Emberton’s distinct choreographic style and sense of theatre make this is a “visually exquisite” work.

“_Fascinating to behold throughout … superb and captivating piece of work … Quite a standard-setter for … Welsh dance_”

\- Wales Arts Review

“_A choreographer who is able to excite and stimulate but also entertain with flowing, aesthetically pleasing dance_”

\- Arts Scene in Wales
