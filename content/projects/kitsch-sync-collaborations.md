Various, performance collaborations with Kitsch & Sync Collective for events, festivals, and stage performances.

Kitsch & Sync are a curiously quirky dance theatre and performance collective. Fusing different dance genres, character and comedy with a vintage or retro twist. They specialise in creating dance and theatre pieces and acts for outdoor sites, festivals, events and venues. Audiences can expect quirky choreography, surreal characters, toe tapping tunes and a dressing-up box bursting with enough vintage clobber to make your gran proud!

Kitsch & Sync Collective is fast building a reputation for itself as one of Walesâ€™ most exciting, original and eclectic companies. Immediately recognisable by their innovative brand of cabaret-inspired dance theatre, the company was set up in 2011 by Wales-based performance artists Kylie Ann Smith, Rosalind Brooks and Kim Noble, and has become a popular feature at many a festival ever since.
