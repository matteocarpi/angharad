_Before I leave I’ll give you some happiness_

_The laughter and pain, the good that remains_

_Hold me tighter still, keep me safe until_

_Hold me close, before I leave_

In Merthyr, people who are losing themselves find each other in a choir for individuals living with dementia and Alzheimer’s.

A funny, moving and ultimately uplifting production featuring covers of well-known songs by artists ranging from Tom Jones to the Sex Pistols, plus a new song by Nicky Wire and James Dean Bradfield of Manic Street Preachers.

May - June 2016 / Sherman Theatre, Cardiff
