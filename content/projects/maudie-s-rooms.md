Set inside a splendid, fading old Custom's House in Cardiff Bay, Maudie's Rooms is a sumptuously visual, promenade adventure for family audiences, with inside-out magical environments, scents, sounds, unsolved mysteries and a cracking story.

Professor Arlo Butterworth is in a dreadful pickle. Having abandoned poor Harriet at the altar, he now finds himself completely lost! Now, right out of the blue, he has received a mysterious message summonsing him back to the old seaside boarding house of his childhood. Join Arlo on his perilous journey, as he once again encounters the extraordinary Lodgers in Maudie's rooms - and remembers the lessons from his past.
