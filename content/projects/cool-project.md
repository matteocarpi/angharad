**NORMAN BATES IS INNOCENT!**

How much do we really know each other, even those we love?

**TWELVE CABINS TWELVE VACANCIES** interlinks personal tragedy with the events of Alfred Hitchcock’s seminal sixties horror classic **PSYCHO.**

“Dad died during the first broadcast of Psycho on network TV. Earlier that evening it had been scorching hot in the back yard. There was no breeze. I was 12. And I knew.” At the same time Marion stepped into the shower. This is the moment”

Blending memory with poetic imagery **COMPANY OF** **SIRENS** new piece **TWELVE CABINS TWELVE** **VACANCIES** traces Marion Crane’s journey to the Bates motel and one boy’s entry into a world where things don’t remain the same and where foundations shake.

Written, conceived, directed and performed by Chris Durnall with Angharad Matthews, and original music by Rhys Anderson, **TWELVE CABINS TWELVE** **VACANCIES** is about the nature of loss and how events are captured and treasured in the memory.

**Tuesday 11th June at 8.30 and Wednesday 12th June at 6.30 and 8.00**
