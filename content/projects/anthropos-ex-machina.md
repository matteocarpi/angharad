#### ANTHROPOS EX (MACHINA)

##### Play, performative installation and live concert

##### Collaboration by Sonja Kessner, Anton Pohle, Cathrein Unger, Peter Posniak, Anton August Dudda, Angharad Matthews, Adrian Williams, wer.werther, Leonard WÃ¶lfl, Jenny Fitz, Kinbom & Kessner + Band (Fredrik Kinbom, Sonja Kessner, Chris Farr , Andreas Dormann).

##### The whimsical ornithologist Ziggi Zuheegen lives a secluded life in a strange place that is vaguely reminiscent of a small living room in a new urban development and is engrossed in her research. To celebrate her birthday, she invites you into her sparse living room. The celebration will initially take place on a small scale. Musician Nicolas is booked to serenade her and all seems peaceful. With the visit of Ziggi's obscure aunt Roswitha, however, reality begins to crack. She administers the two a mixture of love potion and truth serum and finally leads them into the surreal world of Ziggi's subconscious: heat and rain, past and future, man and machine combine and form a kaleidoscope of human (im)possibility.

##### "Anthropos Ex (Machina)" combines absurd theatre, performative installation and live concert. Theater.Macht.Staat and guests from the visual arts, dance and video art and the theater music duo Kinbom & Kessner + Band will be there with music from their current album "Anthropos" (Hook Music/Theater der Zeit).

##### March 24th and 25th, 2023 at 7 p.m. in the [Brotfabrik](https://www.brotfabrik-berlin.de/) , Caligariplatz 1, 13358 Berlin. For [advance ticket sales](https://www.eventbrite.de/e/anthropos-ex-machina-tickets-551703799917) .
