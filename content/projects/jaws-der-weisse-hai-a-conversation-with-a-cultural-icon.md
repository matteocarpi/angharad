#### JAWS/DER WEISSE HAI  

#### A Conversation With a Cultural Icon

A creation of English Theatre Berlin | International Performing Arts Center

By examining the (then) critical content and (dwindling) relevance of Steven Spielberg’s 1975 movie Jaws, its images, its music, its evocative qualities, we’re dancing and performing an entertaining and critical conversation with a cultural icon – the mega blockbuster Jaws, a movie about a fish, a threat and a hunt. In 1975, the white shark had to serve as a powerful metaphor, and the film’s worldwide success led to decades of demonisation of an animal species – but it also opened up a view of the impending ecological catastrophe. At the same time preparations for a new era began. After ten years of youthful optimism, but also mistrust, defeat and fear – Nixon and Watergate; defeat in the Vietnam War, the oil crisis and economic decline – Jaws showed a society banding together in the face of a grave threat, recalling its old values and again producing heroes from its midst. “We’re gonna need a bigger boat!”
