Fear is the most widespread, undetected, un-acknowledged of taboos. It is only when a person with no fear appears in our life that we can go back to living

Combining cutting edge circus, performance, live music, and video the audience enter the tent and become immersed in a promenade circus event taking place above around and amongst the audience in an explosion of furious fun and choreographed mayhem.

Leave your circus preconceptions behind and join us for a turbo charged, ninety-minute, life changing roller coaster ride.

‘Cirque Du Soleil without the Disney and the disinfectant… this is the future of British Circus.’  
\- The Guardian

‘a vividly entertaining and tumultuous new promenade production’
