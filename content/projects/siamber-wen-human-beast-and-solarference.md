A promenade performance, from Human Beast and Solarference, directed by Joe Wild. A team of 5 artists bring music, dance, mask and Chinese pole together, in this haunting physical performance. Rooted in Welsh folk song, sliced with digital technology, sung into life: a dark story of incest and family. There is poetry, a may pole, a dance of carrion crows, and love-making of the darkest kind.

**Created and performed by** - Joe Wild, Laura Moy, Ceri Elen, Nick Janaway, and Sarah Owen

**Costume Design** - Angharad Matthews
