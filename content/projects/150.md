National Theatre Wales and Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru in association with S4C  
Created and directed by Marc Rees  
​Royal Opera House Stores, Abercwmboi, Aberdare

Wales’ two national theatre companies – National Theatre Wales and Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru – teamed up for the very first time, with one of the country’s leading artists, Marc Rees, and broadcaster S4C to create ​a visual and storytelling feast.

Performed in English, Welsh and Spanish, {150} brought to life key moments in the story of the 150 Welsh men, women and children who settled in Patagonia in 1865, and the lives of their descendants today.

This multi-platform production, combining live performance in Wales with a specially commissioned film from Patagonia, was staged in the Royal Opera House stores near Aberdare – a vast building not normally open to the public, close to the homes of many of the original settlers.
