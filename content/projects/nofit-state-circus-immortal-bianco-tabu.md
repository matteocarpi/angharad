BIANCO is a promenade experience unlike any other. With innovative rigging and counter- weighting techniques, BIANCO takes place above, behind and all around the audience, in an up-close and all-consuming theatrical spectacular.

In partnership with the Eden Project. The promenade show, directed by Firenza Guidi, ran in the tented performance space throughout the summer, and was described by _This Is Cornwall_ as "an incredible experience". The show was then redeveloped to incorporate new ideas, acts and performers in 2013 to become _Bianco: Turning Savage_. It opened at The Roundhouse in April 2013, and was praised by _The Guardian_ newspaper for "combining first-rate skills with a joyful, unashamed pleasure". _Bianco: Turning Savage_ went on to tour venues across the UK in NoFit State's custom-designed big top spaceship tent, including a sell-out run at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2013. In 2014 the show toured to Perth, Australia, around Europe, and continued touring in 2015.

London’s Southbank Centre for the first time, running from 23 November 2016 – 22 January 2017.
