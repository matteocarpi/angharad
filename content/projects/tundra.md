# **TUNDRA**

## NDCW

Nominee at the UK Theatre Awards 2018 (Best Achievement in Dance).

Best Dance Wales Theatre Awards 2017.

Tundra is a barren landscape where ultra-modern creativity blinks into life and tears pages from history books about Russian folk dance, the USSR and revolution.

Marcos Morauâ€™s bold style draws inspiration from art and cinema. Tundra takes old ideas and uses contemporary dance to give them renewed meaning.
