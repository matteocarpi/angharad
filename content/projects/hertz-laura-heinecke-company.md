#### HERTZ

##### THE WORLD IS VIBRATION | LAURA HEINECKE & COMPANY (POTSDAM)

10 – 12 NOV 2022 | DANCE / PERFORMANCE

Sounds, colours, touch. The world is vibration. We can hear it, see it, feel it. It can hurt, it can please, it can be enjoyable. "What do vibrations do to us?", asks Laura Heinecke. Last year she conducted research with scientists and body practitioners in the studio for weeks. They experimented on a visual, acoustic, and somatic level with wavelengths, pitches, vibrations, intensities, and rhythm. Laura Heinecke's new piece _HERTZ_ takes the audience on a journey of discovery into the land of vibrations. Dance is vibration. Life is vibration. Every cell vibrates with its own specific rhythm. What would change if we related more to our own vibrations? If we were to resonate? What resonance space opens up for us?

Afterward on Nov 11: talk with the artists
