# THE CREATURE

### COMPANY OF SIRENS

‘Misery has made me a fiend’

When someone kills, when their crime is so terrible, so incomprehensible, can we still call them human? Who is to blame? Who and what creates monsters?

Taking Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein as inspiration, **THE CREATURE** takes place in the mind and the prison cell of a young boy in a secure unit, as he attempts to avoid taking responsibility for what he has done, but also tries to understand it.

Following last years acclaimed production of THE WOLF TATTOO by Lucy Gough, **COMPANY OF SIRENS** present a specially commissioned play from the same award winning author that explores the origins of criminal behaviour and asks what it is that makes us monsters.

Developed through work with young offenders in prisons and secure units. **THE CREATURE** is a powerful new play dealing with an issue central to our lives.
