# THE CREATURE

### COMPANY OF SIRENS

When someone kills, when their crime is so terrible, so incomprehensible, can we still call them human? Who is to blame? Who and/or what creates monsters?

Taking Mary Shelley’s _Frankenstein_ as inspiration, The Creature takes place in the mind and the prison cell of a young boy in a secure unit as he attempts to avoid taking responsibility for what he has done whilst also trying to understand it.

Developed through work with young offenders, this specially commissioned play explores the origins of criminal behaviour and asks what it is that makes us monsters.

_The Creature_ is a companion-piece, of sorts, to [_The Wolf Tattoo_](https://www.britishtheatreguide.info/reviews/the-wolf-tattoo-seligman-studio-16055), the previous collaboration between playwright Lucy Gough and director Chris Durnall’s Company of Sirens. But while that play was set in a dystopian society menaced by feral youths, _The Creature_ gives us access to an entirely private hell.

As the play begins, three figures are entwined beneath a bare, metal table. When they emerge and disengage from one another, we see that they are dressed in identical grey jogging-bottoms and hoodies. The ambience is austere, the only other design element being a demure blue dress suspended from the ceiling.

It soon becomes evident that we (the action unfolding in-the-round, the audience on a level with the actors) are in a prison cell, and that the three protagonists are, in fact, one—Matt Reed’s Son 1, and Sons 2 and 3, played by Jarred Ellis Thomas and Angharad Matthews (also the show’s designer), who represent the voices in his head—the female element the more sinister, the male more tentative. The boy clutches and obsessively quotes from a book taken from the prison library—Mary Shelley’s _Frankenstein_.
